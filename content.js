				"Despite its significant impact on modern day life, many people have misconceptions about what computer<br>" +
				"science is actually about. Here's a list of common misconceptions, and why they're untrue.<br>" +
				"<ul>" +
				"<li>Computer science is about being able to use computer programs</li>" +
				"<li style='margin-left:2em'>Computer science consists of more than being able to use regular computer programs. In fact,<br>" +
				"computer scientists probably designed and created that program!</li>" +
				"<li>Computer science is about programming</li>" +
				"<li style='margin-left:2em'>This is a fairly narrow view of computer science; though programming is certainly something<br>" +
				"many computer scientists can do, there are many aspects of computer science that have<br>" +
				"nothing to do with programming!</li>" +
				"<li>Computer science is about computer repair and IT</li>" +
				"<li style='margin-left:2em'>Actually, computer science has very little to do with computer repair. Computers are merely the<br>" +
				"tools of the trade, like how astronomers use telescopes or chemists use test tubes. Also, though<br>" +
				"it's a nice bonus to be able to fix your own tool, it's not a requirement in the slightest.</li>" +
				"<li>Computer science sounds boring</li>" +
				"<li style='margin-left:2em'>At the end of the day, computer science influences everything, from electric cars to mobile<br>" +
				"phones like the one in your pocket. I'd hardly call that boring!</li>" +
				"<li>Computer science lacks creativity</li>" +
				"<li style='margin-left:2em'>Computer science relies heavily on problem solving skills, and many of the advances made<br>" +
				"in the field required sparks of creativity. You'll especially need some </li>" +
				"<li>Computer science is for geeks</li>" +
				"<li style='margin-left:2em'>Most certainly not! This is possibly a myth perpetuated by popular media; regardless, it is far from<br>" +
				"the truth. Athletes to business analysts can all learn and apply computer science to their respective<br>" +
				"fields.</li>" +
				"<li>Computer science is not for women</li>" +
				"<li style='margin-left:2em'>Computer science is most definitely not a gender-specific science, just like any other science.<br>" +
				"In fact, there are many notable women that have made major contributions to the field, and we<br>" +
				"hope that this continues to be the case!</li>" +
