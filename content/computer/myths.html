            <h1>Myths About Computer Science</h1>
            <p>Despite its significant impact on modern day life, many people have misconceptions about what computer science is actually about. Here's a list of common misconceptions, and why they're untrue.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Computer science is about programming</h2>
            <p>This is a fairly narrow view of computer science; though programming is certainly something many computer scientists can do, there are many aspects of computer science that have nothing to do with programming!</p>

            <h2>It's about being able to use computer programs</h2>
            <p>Computer science consists of more than being able to use regular computer programs. In fact, computer scientists probably designed and created that program!</p>
                        
            <h2>Computer science is about computer repair and IT</h2>
            <p>Actually, computer science has very little to do with computer repair. Computers are merely the tools of the trade, like how astronomers use telescopes or chemists use test tubes. Also, though it's a nice bonus to be able to fix your own tool, it's not a requirement in the slightest.</p>

            <h2>Computer science sounds boring</h2>
            <p>At the end of the day, computer science influences everything, from electric cars to mobile phones like the one in your pocket. I'd hardly call that boring!</p>
 
            <h2>Computer science lacks creativity</h2>
            <p>Computer science relies heavily on problem solving skills, and many of the advances made in the field required sparks of creativity. You'll especially need some</p>

            <h2>Computer science is for geeks</h2>
            <p>Most certainly not! This is possibly a myth perpetuated by popular media; regardless, it is far from the truth. Athletes to business analysts can all learn and apply computer science to their respective fields.</p>

            <h2>Computer science is not for women</h2>
            <p>Computer science is most definitely not a gender-specific science, just like any other science. In fact, there are many notable women that have made major contributions to the field, and we hope that this continues to be the case!</p>
