            <h1>Co-op Program</h1>
            <p>Our co-op program is highly respected by employers, offering students paid work experience and a great competitive advantage upon graduating.</p>
            <p>Students enrolled in co-op will add 4 work terms to their degree schedule, during summer, fall or winter, and gain a total of 16 months work experience in the field. This gives computer science students at UNB the opportunity to gain not only a university degree but an impressive resume as well.</p>
