            <h1>Co-op Program</h1>
            <p>Our co-op program is highly respected by employers, offering students paid work experience and a great competitive advantage upon graduating.</p>
            <p>Students enrolled in co-op can add 4 or 8 work terms to their degree schedule, up to 6 times over the course of their degree, gaining over 16 months work experience in the field. This gives computer science students at UNB the opportunity to gain real-world experience on top of their university degree. An impressive head start, to say the least!</p>
