            <h1>Student Life in Computer Science at UNB</h1>
            <h2>Encouraging Environment</h2>
            <p>UNB’s Computer Science program has lots of opportunities for students. Free tutoring is offered to first year students, and there is always a friendly face willing to help outside of tutoring hours.</p>
            <h2>Concurrent Degrees</h2>
            <p>There is plenty of room in the course schedule for specializations and concurrent degree programs, allowing students to work simultaneously towards a degree in Computer Science and a degree in Arts or Sciences.</p>
            <h2>Computer Science Association</h2>
            <p>Also known as the "CSA", the Computer Science Association hosts exciting events throughout the year, such as board game nights, bake sales, lock-ins and more. Becoming a member gives students discounts on many other computer science events such as pancake breakfast and the end of year banquet.</p>
            <h2>House Cup</h2>
            <p>During their first year students are placed in separate houses, named after famous influencial computer scientists. Once assigned a house students are a member for life. Throughout the year houses compete for the house cup, gaining points through participation and victory in events like dodgeball, pumpkin carving, charity drives, videogame marathons and more.</p>
