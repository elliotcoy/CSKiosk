            <h1>Student Life at UNB</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Computer science at UNB Fredericton offers a great student community.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each student joins a house and competes throughout the year for the house cup. Houses gain points through many events such as dodgeball, pumpkin carving, charity drives, videogame marathons and more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Also, join the Computer Science Association and participate in many social events during the year including movie nights, pancake breakfasts and our annual End-of-Year Celebration Banquet.</p>
