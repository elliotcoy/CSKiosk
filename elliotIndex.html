                    Computer What? <br>
                    This page will start by telling users what computer science is not, as in our interviews there was numerous people who
                    were not only uninformed, but misinformed. Next we will define the field of computer science, touching on relevant
                    concepts such as programming, problem solving, algorithms and data systems. This section will also mention the typical
                    skills that will aid and abed potential students. Additionally, this will give users an idea if computer science will be a
                    good mesh with their skills and abilities.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    Careers in Computer Science<br>
                    In this section, we will promote the many different careers available in the field of Computer Science. Ranging
                    anywhere from Web Developer, Quality Assurance, Security Analyst, and Data Centered Systems, as well as different
                    careers with companies such as NB Power, Irving, IBM Canada, Microsoft, etc. We will also explain that, with the variety
                    of jobs, there is also a huge demand for graduates with degrees in Computer Science and that many students currently
                    in our program graduate job ready, as well as have jobs lined up for when they graduate.<br><br>
                    Computer Science at UNB<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    Here we will focus on the benefits of attending UNB as a student in the Faculty of Computer Science. We will also talk
                    about the CS Houses and the House Cup challenges and events that occur throughout the academic year as well as the
                    multiple events the Computer Science Association organizes. The user will be informed about the advantages of
                    completing their Computer Science Degree at UNB, such as our course selection, co-op program, and concurrent
                    offerings.<br><br>
                    How to Apply<br>
                    This final section will present information for the user to complete the next step of actually applying for the Computer
                    Science program. It will include contact information for UNB’s Faculty of Computer Science and include a form similar
                    to the request for information on UNB’s website, allowing the user to get for more information mailed to them directly
                    about UNB as a whole and the Faculty of Computer Science.<br>.
